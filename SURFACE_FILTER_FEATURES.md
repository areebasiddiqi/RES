# Enhanced Surface Filter Features

## Overview

The RunEveryStreet application now includes enhanced surface filtering capabilities that allow users to better understand and manage road surface types in their route planning. This addresses the issue where OSM data may not correctly tag road surfaces, leading to non-driveable surfaces being included in the "unknown" category.

## New Features

### 1. Surface Preview Mode
- **Preview Button**: Each surface type has a üëÅ button that allows you to highlight that specific surface type on the map
- **Visual Highlighting**: When previewing a surface, it appears in bright yellow while other surfaces are dimmed
- **Statistics Display**: Shows the count of roads for the previewed surface type
- **Toggle Functionality**: Click the same preview button again to disable preview mode

### 2. Color-Coded Surface Types
Roads are now color-coded by surface category for easy visual identification:

- **Cyan (Paved)**: asphalt, concrete, paving_stones, sett, cobblestone, metal, wood
- **Green (Gravel)**: compacted, fine_gravel, gravel, pebblestone  
- **Orange (Unpaved)**: unpaved, ground, dirt, grass, grass_paver, gravel_turf, soil, woodchips
- **Red (Rough)**: rock, sand, mud
- **Blue (Weather)**: ice, salt, snow
- **Magenta (Unknown)**: unknown surfaces

### 3. Enhanced Surface Filter UI
- **Statistics Panel**: Shows count and percentage of roads for each surface type
- **Color Indicators**: Each surface type has a color indicator matching its map representation
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected surfaces have green backgrounds, deselected have red backgrounds
- **Bulk Operations**: "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons for quick filtering

### 4. Visual Legend
- **Automatic Display**: A legend appears in the bottom-right corner showing surface categories
- **Dynamic Content**: Only shows categories that have roads in the current dataset
- **Keyboard Shortcut Hint**: Reminds users to press 'S' for surface filters

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **S Key**: Toggle surface filter UI open/closed
- **P Key**: Toggle surface preview mode (alternative to using preview buttons)

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Surface Filtering
1. Load road data (either from OSM or imported files)
2. Press 'S' or click "Surface Filters (S)" button
3. Use checkboxes to enable/disable surface types
4. Click "Apply Filters & Reload Data" to update the map

### Surface Preview
1. Open the Surface Filters panel
2. Click the üëÅ button next to any surface type
3. The selected surface type will be highlighted in yellow on the map
4. Other surfaces will be dimmed for better contrast
5. Click the same button again to disable preview mode

### Understanding Surface Statistics
- The UI shows both count and percentage for each surface type
- This helps identify which surface types are most common in your area
- Useful for understanding OSM tagging patterns and data quality

### Color Legend
- The legend in the bottom-right shows surface categories present in your data
- Colors match the actual road colors on the map
- Helps users understand what they're looking at

## Technical Implementation

### Surface Color Mapping
```javascript
var surfaceColorMap = {
    'paved': [120, 255, 255, 0.8],      // Cyan
    'asphalt': [120, 255, 255, 0.8],    // Cyan
    'concrete': [120, 255, 255, 0.8],   // Cyan
    // ... more surface types
};
```

### Preview Mode Variables
```javascript
var surfacePreviewMode = false;
var surfacePreviewType = null;
var surfaceFilterStats = {};
```

### Edge Rendering Enhancement
The Edge class now supports surface-based coloring and preview highlighting:
- Normal mode: Uses surface color mapping
- Preview mode: Highlights selected surface type in yellow, dims others

## Benefits

1. **Better Data Understanding**: Users can see exactly what surface types are present in their data
2. **Improved Route Planning**: Easy identification of surface types helps in route selection
3. **Data Quality Assessment**: Statistics help identify OSM tagging issues
4. **Visual Clarity**: Color coding makes it easy to distinguish surface types at a glance
5. **Interactive Exploration**: Preview mode allows focused examination of specific surface types

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Surface type filtering during route calculation
- Surface-based route optimization
- Export of surface statistics
- Custom surface type definitions
- Surface quality ratings

## Testing

Use the `test_surface_filters.html` file to test the new features:
1. Load some road data
2. Open the Surface Filters panel
3. Try the preview functionality
4. Check the color legend
5. Test keyboard shortcuts

The enhanced surface filter system provides a much more intuitive and powerful way to work with road surface data, addressing the original issue of OSM tagging inconsistencies while providing valuable insights into the road network composition.
