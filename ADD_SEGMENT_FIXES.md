# Add Segment Tool Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Mode Conflict and Workflow Interruption
**Problem**: When exiting add segment mode, the tool would return to `selectnodemode` instead of preserving the previous mode (like `trimmode` or `solveRESmode`), breaking the normal workflow.

**Root Cause**: The `toggleAddSegmentMode()` function was hardcoded to return to `selectnodemode` when exiting add segment mode.

**Fix**: 
- Added `previousMode` variable to track the mode before entering add segment mode
- Updated `toggleAddSegmentMode()` to restore the previous mode when exiting
- Added proper message restoration based on the restored mode

### 2. Missing Route Calculation Button
**Problem**: After exiting add segment mode, the route calculation button would disappear, preventing users from continuing the normal workflow.

**Root Cause**: The mode restoration wasn't properly handling the different workflow states (trim mode, solve mode, download mode).

**Fix**:
- Added proper mode-specific message restoration
- Ensured the correct workflow state is maintained after exiting add segment mode
- Added `showNodes()` calls to recalculate the closest node for proper interaction

### 3. Black Roads Display Issue
**Problem**: After adding segments and exiting add segment mode, roads would appear black or not display properly.

**Root Cause**: The network display wasn't being refreshed after adding segments, causing rendering issues.

**Fix**:
- Added `refreshNetworkDisplay()` function to properly refresh the network state
- Ensures all nodes have updated coordinates
- Resets edge travels for proper display
- Forces redraw of edges and nodes

### 4. Network Integration Issues
**Problem**: Added segments weren't properly integrating with the existing network, causing connectivity issues.

**Root Cause**: New segments weren't being properly connected to the network, and orphan nodes weren't being recalculated.

**Fix**:
- Updated `addSegmentBetweenNodes()` to recalculate total edge distance
- Added orphan node recalculation when in trim or solve mode
- Ensured new segments are properly integrated with the existing network

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Added Mode Tracking
```javascript
var previousMode = null; // Track the mode before entering add segment mode
```

### 2. Enhanced `toggleAddSegmentMode()` Function
- Saves current mode before entering add segment mode
- Restores previous mode when exiting
- Provides mode-specific message restoration
- Calls `refreshNetworkDisplay()` to ensure proper rendering

### 3. Improved `addSegmentBetweenNodes()` Function
- Recalculates total edge distance
- Calls `removeOrphans()` when in appropriate modes
- Ensures proper network integration

### 4. Added `refreshNetworkDisplay()` Function
- Updates all node coordinates
- Resets edge travels
- Recalculates closest node
- Forces edge redraw

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Seamless Workflow**: Add segment mode no longer interrupts the normal workflow
2. **Proper Mode Restoration**: Users return to the exact state they were in before entering add segment mode
3. **Visual Consistency**: Roads display properly after adding segments
4. **Network Integration**: Added segments properly connect to the existing network
5. **Clear Feedback**: Appropriate messages are shown based on the current mode

## Workflow Integration

The add segment tool now properly integrates with the normal workflow:

1. **Trim Mode**: Users can add segments while trimming, then continue trimming
2. **Solve Mode**: Users can add segments during route calculation, then continue calculating
3. **Download Mode**: Users can add segments before downloading the route

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Mode Transitions**: Enter add segment mode from different modes and verify proper restoration
2. **Test Segment Addition**: Add segments and verify they connect properly to existing network
3. **Test Visual Display**: Verify roads display correctly after adding segments
4. **Test Workflow Continuity**: Ensure the normal workflow continues after exiting add segment mode
5. **Test Network Connectivity**: Verify that added segments don't create orphan nodes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Undo for Added Segments**: Add ability to undo segment additions
2. **Segment Validation**: Add validation to prevent invalid segment connections
3. **Visual Feedback**: Add better visual feedback during segment creation
4. **Bulk Segment Addition**: Allow adding multiple segments in sequence
