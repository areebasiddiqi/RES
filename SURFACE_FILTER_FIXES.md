# Surface Filter and Preview System Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Surface Name Discrepancy
**Problem**: The selected surface in the Surface Filters panel didn't match the previewed name in the legend panel.

**Root Cause**: The `drawSurfaceLegend()` function was showing broad category names (like "Paved") instead of the specific surface type being previewed (like "asphalt").

**Fix**: Updated `drawSurfaceLegend()` to show the specific surface type when in preview mode, with a clear "(Preview Mode)" indicator.

### 2. Checkbox Purpose Clarification
**Problem**: Users were confused about the purpose of the two checkboxes in the Surface Filters panel.

**Explanation**:
- **Left checkbox**: Filter checkbox - includes/excludes this surface type from the data
- **üëÅ button**: Preview button - highlights this specific surface type on the map

**Fix**: Added clear comments in the code and improved the UI to make the distinction obvious.

### 3. Preview Not Working After Multiple Filter Applications
**Problem**: After applying filters multiple times, the preview system would show a message but display nothing.

**Root Cause**: The `surfaceFilterStats` weren't being recalculated after applying filters, so the preview system didn't know which surfaces were still available.

**Fixes**:
1. Added `calculateSurfaceStats()` call at the end of `getOverpassData()` to ensure stats are updated after data loading
2. Added validation in `toggleSurfacePreview()` to check if the surface type still exists in the current data
3. Added automatic reset of preview mode when filters are applied to prevent showing invalid previews

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Updated `drawSurfaceLegend()` function
- Now shows specific surface type name when in preview mode
- Uses yellow text to indicate preview mode
- Falls back to category display when not in preview mode

### 2. Enhanced `toggleSurfacePreview()` function
- Added validation to check if surface type exists in current data
- Provides helpful error message when surface type is not found
- Improved error handling for edge cases

### 3. Updated `reloadDataWithFilters()` function
- Automatically resets preview mode when filters are applied
- Prevents showing invalid previews after filter changes

### 4. Added surface stats recalculation
- Ensures `surfaceFilterStats` are always up-to-date after data loading
- Prevents stale statistics from causing preview issues

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Preview mode now clearly shows which surface type is being highlighted
2. **Better Error Messages**: Users get helpful feedback when trying to preview non-existent surfaces
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Preview mode resets when filters change, preventing confusion
4. **Consistent Statistics**: Surface counts are always accurate and up-to-date

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Surface Preview**: Select different surface types and verify the legend shows the correct name
2. **Test Filter Application**: Apply filters multiple times and verify preview still works
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Try to preview surfaces that don't exist in the current data
4. **Test UI Clarity**: Verify that the checkbox vs preview button distinction is clear

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Preview**: Consider maintaining preview state across filter changes if the surface type still exists
2. **Multiple Surface Preview**: Allow previewing multiple surface types simultaneously
3. **Enhanced Legend**: Add more detailed surface information in the legend
4. **Filter Presets**: Add common filter combinations as presets
