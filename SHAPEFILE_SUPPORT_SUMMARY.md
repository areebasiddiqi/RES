# Shapefile Support Enhancement

## Problem Description
The shapefile import feature was limited to only supporting Polyline (3) and Polygon (5) shape types. When users tried to import shapefiles with other common types like PointZ (11), they would receive an error message indicating that only Polyline and Polygon were supported.

## Root Cause
The shapefile parsing code in `parseShapefileBinaryFromBuffer()` function had a hardcoded check that only allowed shape types 3 and 5:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - Limited support
if (shapeType !== 3 && shapeType !== 5) { // 3 = Polyline, 5 = Polygon
    showMessage('Shapefile contains shape type ' + shapeType + '. Only Polyline (3) and Polygon (5) are supported for road networks.');
    return;
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Shape Type Support
Added support for all common shape types that could represent road networks:

**Supported Shape Types:**
- **Point (1)**: Individual points converted to small line segments
- **Polyline (3)**: Line features (roads, paths) - original support
- **Polygon (5)**: Area features treated as boundary lines - original support
- **MultiPoint (8)**: Multiple points converted to line segments
- **PointZ (11)**: 3D points with elevation data
- **PolylineZ (13)**: 3D lines with elevation data
- **PolygonZ (15)**: 3D polygons with elevation data
- **MultiPointZ (18)**: 3D multiple points
- **PointM (21)**: Points with measure data
- **PolylineM (23)**: Lines with measure data
- **PolygonM (25)**: Polygons with measure data
- **MultiPointM (28)**: Multiple points with measure data

### 2. Added Helper Functions
Created comprehensive helper functions for shape type management:

```javascript
function getShapeTypeName(shapeType) {
    const shapeTypes = {
        0: 'Null Shape',
        1: 'Point',
        3: 'Polyline',
        5: 'Polygon',
        8: 'MultiPoint',
        11: 'PointZ',
        13: 'PolylineZ',
        15: 'PolygonZ',
        18: 'MultiPointZ',
        21: 'PointM',
        23: 'PolylineM',
        25: 'PolygonM',
        28: 'MultiPointM'
    };
    return shapeTypes[shapeType] || 'Unknown (' + shapeType + ')';
}

function isShapeTypeSupported(shapeType) {
    const supportedTypes = [1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28];
    return supportedTypes.includes(shapeType);
}
```

### 3. Unified Shape Record Parsing
Created a unified parsing function that handles all supported shape types:

```javascript
function parseShapeRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType) {
    switch (shapeType) {
        case 1: // Point
        case 11: // PointZ
        case 21: // PointM
            return parsePointRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType);
        case 3: // Polyline
        case 13: // PolylineZ
        case 23: // PolylineM
            return parsePolylineRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType);
        case 5: // Polygon
        case 15: // PolygonZ
        case 25: // PolygonM
            return parsePolygonRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType);
        case 8: // MultiPoint
        case 18: // MultiPointZ
        case 28: // MultiPointM
            return parseMultiPointRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType);
        default:
            console.warn('Unsupported shape type in record:', shapeType);
            return [];
    }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Point Support
Added parsing for Point, PointZ, and PointM types, converting them to small line segments so they can be included in the road network:

```javascript
function parsePointRecord(dataView, offset, contentLength, shapeType) {
    // Read X, Y coordinates
    let x = dataView.getFloat64(offset, true); // Longitude
    let y = dataView.getFloat64(offset + 8, true); // Latitude
    
    // Skip Z/M coordinates for Z/M types
    if (shapeType === 11 || shapeType === 13 || shapeType === 15 || shapeType === 18) {
        offset += 8; // Skip Z coordinate
    }
    if (shapeType === 21 || shapeType === 23 || shapeType === 25 || shapeType === 28) {
        offset += 8; // Skip M coordinate
    }
    
    // Convert point to small line segment
    return [[[y, x], [y + 0.00001, x + 0.00001]]];
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Polyline/Polygon Support
Updated existing polyline and polygon parsing to handle Z and M variants by skipping the extra coordinate data:

```javascript
// For Z types, skip Z range and coordinates
if (shapeType === 13 || shapeType === 15) {
    offset += 16; // Skip Z min/max
}
// For M types, skip M range and coordinates  
if (shapeType === 23 || shapeType === 25) {
    offset += 16; // Skip M min/max
}
```

### 6. Improved Error Messages
Enhanced error messages to provide more helpful information:

```javascript
// NEW CODE - Better error message
let shapeTypeName = getShapeTypeName(shapeType);
if (!isShapeTypeSupported(shapeType)) {
    showMessage('Shapefile contains shape type ' + shapeType + ' (' + shapeTypeName + '). Supported types: Point, PointZ, PointM, Polyline, PolylineZ, PolylineM, Polygon, PolygonZ, PolygonM, MultiPoint, MultiPointZ, MultiPointM.');
    return;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Broader Compatibility**: Now supports 12 different shape types instead of just 2
2. **Better User Experience**: More informative error messages and support for common shapefile formats
3. **Flexible Point Handling**: Points are converted to small line segments so they can be included in route calculations
4. **3D Data Support**: Handles Z and M coordinate variants (extra data is ignored but files are processed)
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add support for additional shape types if needed

## Testing
Created `test_shapefile_support.html` to verify that all supported shape types are correctly identified and handled.

## Files Modified
- `sketch.js`: Enhanced shapefile parsing logic
- `test_shapefile_support.html`: Test suite for shape type support
- `SHAPEFILE_SUPPORT_SUMMARY.md`: This documentation

The enhancement ensures that users can import a much wider variety of shapefiles, including common formats like PointZ (11) that were previously rejected, making the application more versatile for different data sources.
